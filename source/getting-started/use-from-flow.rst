Use in Microsoft Flow
=======================================

There are two connectors available in Plumsail Actions:

- :ref:`plumsail-documents-getting-started` - provides `a set of actions <../flow/actions/document-processing.html>`_ for operations with Documents.
- :ref:`plumsail-sharepoint-getting-started` - provides `a set of actions <../flow/actions/sharepoint-processing.html>`_ for operations with SharePoint.

If you want to use Plumsail Documents connector, just create a new Flow and search for "Plumsail Documents".

You need to `add Plumsail Documents connector <../flow/create-custom-connector.html>`_ manually. It is not available in global directory yet.

.. _plumsail-documents-getting-started:

Plumsail Documents connector
----------------------------------------

Just search for "Plumsail" and add appropriate action:

   :alt: Screen of Plumsail Actions

When you add an action for the first time you will be asked for *'Connection Name'* and for *'Access Key'*. 

You can type any name for the connection. For example, *'Plumsail Documents'*. Then copy and paste API key that you `created in your Plumsail Account page <sign-up.html#generate-api-key>`_ to *'Access Key'* input.
