Use in Microsoft Flow
=======================================

.. note:: You will need an API key that you can `create in your Plumsail Account page <sign-up.html#generate-api-key>`_.

Add custom connector
--------------------

First of all, you need to add a custom connector to Microsoft Flow. Open Microsoft Flow account then navigate to *'Custom Connectors'*:

   :alt: Microsoft Flow custom connectors menu

Click *'Create custom connector â†’ Import an OpenAPI from URL'*:

.. image:: ../_static/img/getting-started/connector-from-url.png
   :alt: Connector from URL

Fill in name *'Plumsail Documents'* and swagger definition URL:

::

  https://api.plumsail.com/swagger/DocumentsFlow/swagger.json

Once you clicked *'Continue'* you will see *'General'* step of connector configuration:

.. image:: ../_static/img/getting-started/general-connector-step.png
   :alt: General connector configuration

You may want to differentiate this connector from others. In this case, you can assign a custom icon and custom color for it. We suggest this icon:

.. image:: ../_static/img/getting-started/actions-connector-icon.png
   :alt: Connector icon
   :target: ../_static/img/getting-started/actions-connector-icon.png

And this color:

::

  #ce2d7d

Then click *'Continue'*. You should see authentication type screen:

.. image:: ../_static/img/getting-started/2-flow-accesskey-label.png
   :alt: Microsoft Flow access key

Fill in *'Label'* with the value *'Access Key'* and click *'Create connector'*:

.. image:: ../_static/img/getting-started/create-connector-link.png
   :alt: Create Connector link

Create your first flow
----------------------

Once you added a connector, the new actions will be available in your flows:

.. image:: ../_static/img/getting-started/3-plumsail-flow.png
   :alt: Screen of Plumsail Actions

When you add an action for the first time you will be asked for *'Connection Name'* and for *'Access Key'*. 

You can type any name for the connection. For example, *'Plumsail Documents'*. Then copy and paste API key that you `create in your Plumsail Account page <sign-up.html#generate-api-key>`_ to *'Access Key'* input.

Once you clicked *'Create'* you can use Plumsail Actions in your Microsoft Flows. Review *'Microsoft Flow examples'* section in `the root of documentation <../index.html>`_.
