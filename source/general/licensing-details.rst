Licensing details
#################

You can choose your billing cycle â€” purchase for one year or pay month-to-month. The subscription is linked to an email address. It includes a set of actions for Microsoft Flow or Logic apps and access to REST API.

There are three plans available:

- **Dolphin** - includes 2 000 monthly credits
- **Orca** - includes 10 000 monthly credits
- **Whale** - includes 50 000 monthly credits

What are credits?
----------------

In 95% cases 1 call to Actions is 1 credit. 

Each 0.5 Mb generated by a single call to `Plumsail Documents connector <../flow/actions/document-processing.html>`_ is **1 credit**. For example: 1Mb = 2 credits, 1.5Mb = 3 credits. 95% of documents are under 0.5Mb. 

1 call to `Plumsail SP connector <../flow/actions/sharepoint-processing.html>`_ is always **1 credit**.

What happens when credits are spent?
-----------------------------------

When you will get close to spent 70% of your monthly credits, we will send you a notification about it. Thus, you will have enough time to purchase `additional 1000 credits <https://secure.avangate.com/order/product.php?PRODS=4724468&QTY=1&ORDERSTYLE=nLWonJWpmHI=&SHOPURL=https%3A%2F%2Fplumsail.com%2Factions%2Fstore%2F>`_ or pay a differential cost to `start using another plan <upgrade-renew.html>`_. 

Trial license
-------------
